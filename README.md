# R_heatmaps
Making heatmaps with RNAseq data using pheatmap and geom_tile
This markdown demonstrates taking DEseq2 Log2FC output and producing a geom_tile based heatmap (adding clustering with faceting) 
as well as using the pheatmap package (that clusters by default).  
The clustering for the geom_title method would need to be done elsewhere, and loaded into R as a variable tied to gene.ID
